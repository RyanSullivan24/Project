Founded in 2015 by lifelong sports enthusiasts and childhood friends Ryan Sullivan and Bill Smith, Ryan's Card Shop. started in a small garage with a shared dream: to bring the excitement of sports closer to fans through premium trading cards. Initially, the company focused on curating and selling vintage baseball and basketball cards from the 1980s and 1990s, appealing to nostalgia-driven collectors.

Over the years, Ryan's Card Shop grew exponentially, expanding its inventory to include modern cards featuring today’s biggest stars across sports like football, Basketball, and Baeball. With exclusive partnerships, the company introduced its own line of limited-edition, autographed, and holographic cards, gaining recognition for its quality and authenticity. Today, Legends Deck operates out of a state-of-the-art facility, serving collectors globally through an easy-to-navigate online platform and hosting live events for fans and traders.
